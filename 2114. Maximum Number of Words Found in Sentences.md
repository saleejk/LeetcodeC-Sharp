# A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

# You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.

# Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

 

### Example 1:

Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]

Output: 6

Explanation: 

- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- 
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- 
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
- 
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

### Example 2:

Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]

Output: 3

Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 

In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.
 

### Constraints:

1 <= sentences.length <= 100

1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100

sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.

sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.

All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.
